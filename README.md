Langchain PDF Telegram Bot

This Telegram bot handles user-uploaded PDF files, extracts text from them, and uses LangChain and OpenAI's model
for question-answering. It employs two different tools (PDF Search and Google Search) to find answers based
on the contents of PDFs or perform web searches. The goal is to provide users with accurate and relevant answers
to their questions using a combination of local PDF content and external online search.
